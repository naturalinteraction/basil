A repo for my own experiments.


- [x] Set shutter speed
- [x] Print all camera properties
- [x] Save/Load camera properties
- [ ] Arrow keys select property and change its value
- [ ] Determine best resolution for both camera versions (set focus and take multiple test pics)
- [ ] Decide whether to use same resolution for both models
- [ ] Set optimal camera properties programmatically
- [ ] Preview on/off
- [ ] Save image locally
- [ ] Manage network failures (upload queue)
- [ ] Upload image to S3
- [ ] [POSTPONED] Detect camera hardware version (trying to set highest resolution?)
- [ ] [POSTPONED] Detect camera presence
- [ ] [POSTPONED] Camera on/off (250mA, no continuous mode)
- [ ] [POSTPONED] Detect if scene is static
