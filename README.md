# basil

A repo for my own experiments.

#### Specs
1. Measure area with good growth and area with issues.
2. Curve of growth in time.
3. Algorithm is plant-specific. Plant in tray is known.
4. White light.

#### Creating image of SD card:
```
sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=sdimage.img bs=4096 conv=notrunc
```


#### Copying image to SD card:
```
sudo dd if=sdimage.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4096 conv=notrunc
```


#### Checking `dd` progress:
```
sudo kill -USR1 $(pgrep ^dd)
```


#### VNC for Chrome:
<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vncÂ®-viewer-for-google-ch/iabmpiboiopbgfabjmgeedhcmjenhbla>


#### Mount Pi:
```
sshfs pi@or**.ddns.net:basil pi
```


#### Unmount Pi:
```
fusermount -u pi
```


#### Password
```
sshpass -p ********* ssh pi@or**.ddns.net 'bash -s' < do.sh
sshpass -p ********* ssh pi@192.168.1.10 'cd /home/pi/basil ; git pull ; sudo /sbin/shutdown now'
```


#### Sensors
```
blueshift	eth: 192.168.0.6	wifi: DHCP	Pi NoIR Camera V2
redshift	eth: 192.168.0.7	wifi: DHCP	Pi NoIR Camera V2
noir		eth: 192.168.0.8	wifi: DHCP	Pi NoIR Camera V2
visible		eth: 192.168.0.9	wifi: DHCP	Pi Camera Module V2
```
Focus set at 350mm. Ended tests on optical filters on Dec 17th. Since that date, despite the hostname, the difference is just the camera sensor.

To look for local raspberries:
```
sudo nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24 | awk '/^Nmap/{ip=$NF}/B8:27:EB/{print ip}'
```


#### Autostart
Append `@/home/pi/basil/autostart.sh` to `/home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart`


#### Timelapse
```
# 7 fps, other options include hd720, hd480
ffmpeg -r 7 -pattern_type glob -i '*.jpeg' -s hd1080 -vcodec libx264 timelapse.mp4

# with crop w:h:x:y
ffmpeg -r 7 -pattern_type glob -i '*.jpeg' -s hd1080 -vcodec libx264 -filter:v "crop=1050:871:857:776" timelapse.mp4
```


#### Exif Keywords
```
exiftool -keywords <filename>
```

#### Git
Save username and password for 4 months:
```
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=10000000'
```

#### Web server on the sensors
```
pip install twisted
sudo pip install service_identity
pip install service_identity
```
The last command fails but then Twisted is happy anyway.

#### Calibrations
Initial: Needs light. Must be done every time the sensor is turned on.
Auto: Needs light + scene.
Color: Needs light + colorchecker. Can provide final error(s).
