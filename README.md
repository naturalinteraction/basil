# basil

Software for plant sensor devices.

#### Requirements

- Measure uniformity of growth.
- Provide curve of growth in time.

Algorithm is plant-specific. Plant in tray is known. Day of growth is known. White, constant light. Substrate will guarantee good contrast.

#### High-level tasks

- [x] Definition of architectural aspects (image storage, JSON, etc.)
- [x] Design enclosing case
- [x] Hardware specification document
- [ ] Algorithms: segmentation, analysis, calibration
- [ ] Image processing on sensor
- [ ] Design and implement controls on web interface: update firmware, restart, reboot, start-color-calibration, stop-color-calibration (and reload previous properties)
- [ ] Commented source code
- [ ] Operation guide

#### Architectural specs

Algorithms need to know (HTTP GET):
- (a) Unique identifier for the specific crop/tray (to link current processing with previous history)
- (b) Day of growth (0, 1, 2...) - can be calculated since a new (a) is provided
- (c) The recipe or plant kind (can be provided when a new (a) is provided, and it is bound to it)

Single Python 2.7 function for both uploads:
```
def UploadData(image_filename, json_string)  -->  True|False (whether both succeeded)
```
Required scalar outputs:
- Biomass quantity
- Biomass uniformity

Optional outputs:
- Biomass RGB (mean, standard deviation or histogram)
- Biomass HSV (hue, saturation (or vibrance) and intensity; mean, standard deviation or histogram)
- Scene brightness/darkness
- Scene motion
- Biomass motion
- Sensor health (if something is wrong among cpu, memory, disk, temperature, camera properties, calibration...)

#### Tasks dip.py

- [x] List all pictures on S3
- [x] Check if local file exists
- [x] Download pictures that are not here yet
- [x] Group images with the same 'note' and campaign identifier
- [x] Open downloaded images
- [x] Cython threshold function
- [x] Optionally download images from S3
- [x] Display multiple images with the discarded areas, for debugging purposes
- [x] Stable biomass bounding box (also useful for cropping)
- [x] Unit tests, integration tests
- [x] Modularize the image processing pipeline
- [x] Test median blur and blur
- [x] Segmentation: model hole color and dead leaves color
- [x] Segmentation: model substrate color
- [x] Holes: consider their hierarchy
- [x] Segmentation: multi-dimensional k-means clustering as a tool
- [x] Lab, Luv, YUV color spaces
- [x] Superpixels
- [x] Probability map instead of binary mask: likelihood of a pixel to belong to a class based on color and spatial location (neighborhood); blur to diffuse probability
- [x] Find biomass dominant tone based on saturation
- [x] Detect if scene is dark
- [x] Hires image and charts
- [ ] Find biomass segmentation algorithm params automatically
- [ ] Perspective mask, warping for perspective invariant areas
- [ ] Detect if scene is not static (motion detection)
- [ ] Background subtraction
- [ ] ~~Textural information: spatial frequency function pixel by pixel, textons and their neighborhood histograms; Sobel, Scharr and Laplacian on these channels separately: saturation, brightness, luminance + Canny (blurred)~~
- [ ] ~~Retain pixel probability from previous frames (running average)~~
- [ ] ~~Segmentation: Otsu thresholding and adaptive thresholding~~
- [ ] ~~Color analysis inside biomass: histograms~~
- [ ] ~~Holes: pixel-by-pixel~~


#### Tasks cap.py

- [x] Set shutter speed
- [x] Print all camera properties
- [x] Save/Load camera properties
- [x] Arrow keys select property and change its value
- [x] Get/Set camera property value by name
- [x] Set optimal camera properties programmatically
- [x] Preview on/off
- [x] Save image locally, timely
- [x] Include resolution and notes in filenames
- [x] Alternatively show a full resolution image (useful for focusing) or just a convenient thumbnail
- [x] Add uptime to EXIF
- [x] Add source code version to EXIF
- [x] Print source code version when TAB is pressed
- [x] Print date and time the process started (plus uptime) when TAB is pressed
- [x] Add all camera properties to EXIF
- [x] Determine best resolution for both camera versions
- [x] Manage network failures (upload queue)
- [x] Upload image to S3
- [x] Decide whether to use same resolution for both models
- [x] Detect camera hardware version
- [x] Detect camera presence
- [x] Remove all uses of 'global'
- [x] Unzoom when taking picture
- [x] Disable preview automatically (when taking picture)
- [x] Start cap.py at boot
- [x] Update git repo, relaunch cap.py, reboot and shutdown remotely via script on the 4 sensors at once
- [x] Integrate microphone
- [x] Sensor color calibration == Find camera parameters automatically
- [x] Web interface: number of images in queue
- [x] Print 24 errors (with the average squared error)
- [x] Web interface
- [x] Click 4 times instead of 24, perspective grid
- [ ] Compare camera properties that are a result of color calibration and auto calibration across multiple sensors. Which BF? It seems like shutter speed should be at least 5000. Probably find some custom target RGB values with new colorcheckers.
- [ ] ~~Search brightness and contrast values (after the gains are good). Or make sure brightness is 50 and contrast is 10 and so on.~~
- [ ] ~~Further test the exposure metering modes~~
- [ ] ~~Possibly freeze awb but not iso, expo, shutter~~
- [ ] ~~Camera on/off (250mA, no continuous mode)~~


#### Creating image of SD card:
```
sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=sdimage.img bs=4096 conv=notrunc
```


#### Copying image to SD card:
```
sudo dd if=sdimage.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4096 conv=notrunc
```


#### Checking `dd` progress:
```
sudo kill -USR1 $(pgrep ^dd)
```


#### VNC for Chrome:

#### Mount Pi:
```
sshfs pi@or**.ddns.net:basil pi
```


#### Unmount Pi:
```
fusermount -u pi
```


#### Password
```
sshpass -p ********* ssh pi@or**.ddns.net 'bash -s' < do.sh
sshpass -p ********* ssh pi@192.168.1.10 'cd /home/pi/basil ; git pull ; sudo /sbin/shutdown now'
```


#### Sensors
```
blueshift	eth: 192.168.0.6	wifi: DHCP	Pi NoIR Camera V2
redshift	eth: 192.168.0.7	wifi: DHCP	Pi NoIR Camera V2
noir		eth: 192.168.0.8	wifi: DHCP	Pi NoIR Camera V2
visible		eth: 192.168.0.9	wifi: DHCP	Pi Camera Module V2
```
Focus set at 350mm. Ended tests on optical filters on Dec 17th. Since that date, despite the hostname, the difference is just the camera sensor.

To look for local raspberries:
```
sudo nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24 | awk '/^Nmap/{ip=$NF}/B8:27:EB/{print ip}'
```
Visible sensor failed around February 12th. cap.py not running and camera not detected until reboot.


#### Autostart
Append `@/home/pi/basil/autostart.sh` to `/home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart`


#### Timelapse
```
# 7 fps, other options include hd720, hd480
ffmpeg -r 7 -pattern_type glob -i '*.jpeg' -s hd1080 -vcodec libx264 timelapse.mp4

# with crop w:h:x:y
ffmpeg -r 7 -pattern_type glob -i '*.jpeg' -s hd1080 -vcodec libx264 -filter:v "crop=1050:871:857:776" timelapse.mp4
```


#### Exif Keywords
```
exiftool -keywords <filename>
```

#### Git
Save username and password for 4 months:
```
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=10000000'
```

#### Web server on the sensors
```
pip install twisted
sudo pip install service_identity
pip install service_identity
```
The last command fails but then Twisted is happy anyway.

#### Calibrations
- Initial: Needs light. Must be done every time the sensor is turned on.
- Auto: Needs light + scene.
- Color: Needs light + colorchecker. Can provide final error(s).

#### Disable HDMI
Edit `/etc/rc.local` and add the following lines above `exit 0`:
```
# Disable HDMI
/usr/bin/tvservice -o
```
Other interesting settings in `/boot/config.txt`.
