Software for sensor devices.

#### Requirements

- Measure uniformity of growth.
- Provide curve of growth in time.

#### Specifications

- Algorithm is plant-specific.
- Plant in tray is known.
- Measurements across different plant species are not comparable.
- Day of growth is known. Starting day and hour must be known.
- White, constant light.
- Substrate is white or black and plastic.
- Distance and angle are fixed.

#### High-level tasks

- [x] Definition of architectural aspects (image storage, JSON, etc.)
- [x] Design enclosing case
- [x] Hardware specification document
- [x] Design and implement controls on web interface
- [x] Algorithms: segmentation, analysis, calibration
- [ ] Commented source code
- [ ] Operation guide

#### Architectural specs

Algorithms need to know (HTTP GET):
- (a) Unique identifier for the specific crop/tray (to link current processing with previous history)
- (b) Day of growth (0, 1, 2...) - can be calculated since a new (a) is provided
- (c) The recipe or plant kind (can be provided when a new (a) is provided, and it is bound to it)

Single Python 2.7 function for both uploads:
```
def UploadData(image_filename, json_string)  -->  True|False (whether both succeeded)
```

#### Customizing each SD image

Keep record of these (info.sh):
- SD serial
- SD cid
- Pi serial
- eth0 MAC address
- usb0 MAC address
- wlan0 MAC address

Username is the default. Password is the same everywhere. DHCP on usb0, eth0 and wlan0.

Change via script:
- Hostname / hosts file (change_hostname.sh)
- Wifi SSID and password (wifi.py)

- [ ] ~~Prior knowledge is stored somewhere~~
- [ ] ~~Mask~~
- [ ] ~~Textural information: spatial frequency function pixel by pixel, textons and their neighborhood histograms; Sobel, Scharr and Laplacian on these channels separately: saturation, brightness, luminance + Canny (blurred)~~

#### Creating image of SD card:
```
# lsblk to list devices
# partition(s) must be unmounted (with umount; partitions, not the disk itself)
sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=sdimage.img bs=4096 conv=notrunc  # if=/dev/sdb bs=4M
```


#### Copying image to SD card:
```
# lsblk to list devices
# partition(s) must be unmounted (with umount; partitions, not the disk itself)
# be very careful with what follows, see https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md
sudo dd if=sdimage.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4096 conv=notrunc  # of=/dev/sdb bs=4M
```


#### Checking `dd` progress:
```
sudo kill -USR1 $(pgrep ^dd)
```


#### VNC for Chrome:
<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vncÂ®-viewer-for-google-ch/iabmpiboiopbgfabjmgeedhcmjenhbla>


#### Mount Pi:
```
sshfs pi@or**.ddns.net:basil pi
```


#### Unmount Pi:
```
fusermount -u pi
```


#### Password
```
sshpass -p ********* ssh pi@or**.ddns.net 'bash -s' < do.sh
sshpass -p ********* ssh pi@192.168.1.10 'cd /home/pi/basil ; git pull ; sudo /sbin/shutdown now'
```


#### Sensors
```
blueshift	eth: 192.168.0.6	wifi: DHCP	Pi NoIR Camera V2
redshift	eth: 192.168.0.7	wifi: DHCP	Pi NoIR Camera V2
noir		eth: 192.168.0.8	wifi: DHCP	Pi NoIR Camera V2
visible		eth: 192.168.0.9	wifi: DHCP	Pi Camera Module V2
```
Focus set at 350mm. Ended tests on optical filters on Dec 17th. Since that date, despite the hostname, the difference is just the camera sensor.

To look for local raspberries:
```
sudo nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24 | awk '/^Nmap/{ip=$NF}/B8:27:EB/{print ip}'
```

Resolution set to 1280x720 (16:9)

There is no way we can use the Raspberry Pi Zero because sourcing is unreliable.

#### Autostart
Append `@/home/pi/basil/autostart.sh` to `/home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart`


#### Timelapse
```
# 7 fps, other options include hd720, hd480
ffmpeg -r 7 -pattern_type glob -i '*.jpeg' -s hd1080 -vcodec libx264 timelapse.mp4

# with crop w:h:x:y
ffmpeg -r 7 -pattern_type glob -i '*.jpeg' -s hd1080 -vcodec libx264 -filter:v "crop=1050:871:857:776" timelapse.mp4
```


#### Exif Keywords
```
exiftool -keywords <filename>
```

#### Git
Save username and password for 4 months:
```
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=10000000'
```

#### Cython, Scipy, FFmpeg and MQTT
```
pip install Cython
sudo apt-get install python-scipy
pip install paho-mqtt
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

#### Web server on the sensors
```
pip install twisted
sudo pip install service_identity
pip install service_identity
```
The last command fails but then Twisted is happy anyway.

#### Calibrations
- Initial: Needs light. Must be done every time the sensor is turned on.
- Auto: Needs light + scene.
- Color: Needs light + colorchecker. Can provide final error(s).

#### Disable HDMI
Edit `/etc/rc.local` and add the following lines above `exit 0`:
```
# Disable HDMI
/usr/bin/tvservice -o
```
Other interesting settings in `/boot/config.txt`.

#### Ignore changes to file
```
git update-index --assume-unchanged FILE
```
Must be executed on each machine. That means this is part of the installation process.
