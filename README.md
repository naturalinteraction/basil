- [ ] Open downloaded images
- [ ] Examine timelapses

#### Tasks cap.py

- [x] Set shutter speed
- [x] Print all camera properties

- [x] Get/Set camera property value by name
- [x] Set optimal camera properties programmatically
- [x] Preview on/off
- [x] Save image locally, timely
- [x] Include resolution and notes in filenames
- [x] Alternatively show a full resolution image (useful for focusing) or just a convenient thumbnail
- [x] Add uptime to EXIF

- [x] Decide whether to use same resolution for both models
- [x] Detect camera hardware version
- [x] Detect camera presence
- [ ] Update git repo, start and stop cap.py, reboot and shutdown remotely via script on the 4 sensors at once
- [ ] Start cap.py at boot
- [ ] ~~Camera on/off (250mA, no continuous mode)~~
- [ ] ~~Detect if scene is static~~
